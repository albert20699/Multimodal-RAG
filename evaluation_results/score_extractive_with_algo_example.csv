The designs include the following modules:

1. **Input Module**:
   - Processes input data (e.g., a question and facts) into a set of vectorized representations.
   - Uses a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for extracting hidden states from the input facts iteratively.
   - Produces an updated hidden state for each time step using equations (1)-(4).

2. **Question Module**:
   - Converts the input question into a vector representation, which is used for reasoning over the input facts.

3. **Episode Memory Module**:
   - Retrieves and updates memory representations iteratively to answer the question.
   - Consists of two components:
     - **Attention Mechanism**: Produces a contextual vector summarizing relevant information for each pass.
     - **Memory Update Mechanism**: Updates the episodic memory based on the contextual vector and the memory from the previous pass.

4. **Answer Module**:
   - Predicts the final answer based on the processed memory and question representations.
   - Combines the question vector and memory vector for classification or sequence generation tasks.

5. **Improved Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN+)**:
   - Enhancements to the DMN design include:
     - **Input Representation**: Incorporates a **bi-directional GRU** for better encoding of sentences and interactions between words.
     - **Attention Mechanism**: Refines the attention process to better capture relevant information.
     - **Memory Update**: Improves the episodic memory mechanism for higher accuracy on datasets like bAbI and VQA.

Here's how they approach it:

1. **Tagging Backstory Questions:** Instances where users inquire about Gunrock's backstory (e.g., ""What's your favorite color?"") are tagged to assess user interest in the bot's persona.

2. **Linear Regression Modeling:** For users who asked at least one backstory question, the study models the overall user rating using a linear regression with the number of backstory questions asked as the predictor. Since the relationship is nonlinear, both variables are log-transformed for better modeling.

3. **Findings:** They hypothesize and confirm that users who show greater curiosity about Gunrock's backstory tend to provide higher ratings for the conversation overall. The analysis shows a statistically significant positive relationship between the number of backstory questions asked and user satisfaction (log-transformed β = 0.10, SE = 0.002, t = 58.4, p < 0.001).

4. **Implications:** This suggests that maintaining a consistent personality for the chatbot and actively responding to user curiosity about its persona improves user satisfaction.

1. **Aggregation of Attribute Triples with Bias**: KANE incorporates rich semantic information from attribute triples, which are often ignored or underutilized in traditional methods. By explicitly aggregating these triples with bias, KANE ensures that the attribute information is integrated into the predictive model.

2. **Relation Propagation**: KANE performs efficient propagation based on relation triples, enabling the model to factor in high-order relations. This captures the structural information of the KG, allowing the model to understand complex relationships between entities.

3. **Unified Embedding Objective**: All related parameters in KANE are tailored to optimize a unified embedding objective. This ensures that the structural and attribute information are seamlessly integrated into the learning process without redundancy or inefficiency.

4. **Explicit Representation Learning**: Instead of relying solely on direct relations between entities (like TransE or its extensions), KANE explicitly models both structural and attribute information in a unified framework. This explicit modeling approach enhances the predictive capabilities of the embedding.

By combining these strategies, KANE significantly improves the representation of entities and relations, leading to superior performance in tasks like knowledge graph completion compared to baseline methods.","To capture both high-order structural information of KGs, we used an attention-based embedding propagation method.",0,0,0.157894737,0.922232551

Here's how it works:

1. **Attention Mechanism**: The system uses the attention mechanism to identify and focus on relevant parts of the input facts that are most closely related to the question being asked. For example, if the question requires gender or number information, the mechanism prioritizes the input facts that encode this information.

2. **Memory Update Mechanism**: Based on the contextual vector produced by the attention mechanism, the memory update mechanism generates a new memory state. This state integrates the relevant gender and number information along with other facts needed to answer the question accurately.

3. **Iterative Updates**: The episodic memory module performs iterative passes over the input facts, refining and updating the memory state during each pass. This iterative process ensures that the correct gender and number information is consistently incorporated and aligned with the question.

4. **Final Memory State**: By the final pass, the episodic memory module consolidates all the necessary information, including gender and number, into the final memory state. This state is used to produce the answer.

The system's design ensures that the correct morphological features (like gender and number) are selected and preserved throughout the processing. The **question module** and **answer module** further leverage this information to generate the final output, which matches the gender and number requirements as implied by the question."," correct information substantially improves it - we see an increase of up to 2.3 BLEU over the baseline Finally, the “She said” prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion much closer to that of the reference",1,0.5,0,0.899587177

Each sentence encoding scheme taking the word tokens 1 M is the length of the sentence.']","The changes made to the input module include:

1. **Positional Encoding for Sentence Reader**:
   - The sentence reader in the textual input module uses a positional encoding scheme to represent sentences. This encoding ensures that each word token in the sentence is given a position-based representation, allowing for sequential information capture.

2. **Bi-directional GRU for Input Fusion Layer**:
   - A bi-directional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) is adopted for the input fusion layer to enable information exchange between sentences. This mechanism captures both forward and backward context, improving the representation of the input facts.

3. **Visual Input Module for VQA**:
   - For Visual Question Answering (VQA), a new input module is introduced to handle image data. It splits images into small local regions and processes each region as the equivalent of a sentence in the textual input module.
   - The visual input module has three components:
     - **Local Region Feature Extraction**: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from local regions of the image.
     - **Visual Feature Embedding**: Applies a linear layer with tanh activation to project the local region features into the textual feature space for compatibility with textual data.
     - **Input Fusion Layer**: Uses a bi-directional GRU, similar to the textual input module, to process the local region features and produce the input facts.

These changes enhance the input module by improving sentence encoding, enabling bi-directional context flow, and adapting the module for visual data processing in VQA tasks.","For the DMN+, we propose replacing this single GRU with two different components.

1. **Rule-Based Transitions with Adaptive Responses**: 
   - Gunrock employs rule-based transitions between predefined dialog states to ensure effective state management.

2. **Customized Dialog Flow**:
   - Dialog flow is tailored to users by tracking user attributes as dialog contexts.
   - The system introduces variations in dialog flow, reducing scripted and repetitive behavior, and creating a fresh conversational experience.

3. **Mixed-Initiative Interactions**:
   - Users can initiate new dialog modules or switch topics at any point, making the system more flexible and interactive.

4. **Feedback Signals**:
   - Gunrock uses feedback signals like ""continue"" and ""stop"" to gauge user intent and select the most appropriate response module.

5. **Extensive Persona Backstory**:
   - A detailed persona backstory was developed to maintain a consistent personality across interactions. The persona is modeled as a positive, outgoing, and science-and-technology-interested individual.

6. **Knowledge Databases**:
   - Topic dialog modules leverage curated knowledge bases (e.g., EVI factual database) for accurate and specific information retrieval, including movie databases like IMDb for relevant responses.

7. **Natural Language Generation**:
   - To avoid repetitive and generic responses, Gunrock uses a template manager to select handcrafted response templates based on the dialog state.
   - Multiple response templates are mapped to dialog states, ensuring variety in responses while maintaining relevance.

These improvements collectively enhance Gunrock's ability to engage users in dynamic, context-aware, and personalized conversations, making the system more effective and interactive.","the new DMN+ model does not require that supporting facts (i.e. the facts that are relevant for answering a particular question) are labeled during training.

In the second scenario we also have a similar problem as the last layer requires some information to predict the correct']","The auxiliary signals from the morphology table are incorporated into the decoder through an attention mechanism and a dedicated auxiliary output channel. Here's how this integration works:

1. **Morphology Table as External Knowledge**: The morphology table, which contains affixes and morphological annotations, acts as an external knowledge repository. It provides auxiliary signals to the decoder at each time step to enrich the sampling process.

2. **Attention Mechanism**: An attention module is applied over the morphology table to search for the most relevant affixes or annotations for the current prediction. This mechanism assigns weights (\( \beta_{iu} \)) to the embeddings of the affixes (\( f_u \)) based on their relevance to the target token. The attention module filters out irrelevant affixes and amplifies the impact of the relevant ones.

   Mathematically:
   \[
   c^m_i = \sum_{u=1}^{|A|} \beta_{iu} f_u
   \]
   where \( c^m_i \) is the auxiliary signal generated from the morphology table for the \( i \)-th target token, \( \beta_{iu} \) is the attention weight, and \( f_u \) is the embedding of the \( u \)-th affix.

3. **Auxiliary Output Channel**: In addition to the main output channel responsible for generating translations, the second auxiliary channel predicts morphological annotations (\( l_i \)) for the target character. These annotations specify the morphological status or part of the word/morpheme the target character belongs to.

   - For each time step, the first channel generates the target character, while the second channel predicts the corresponding morphological label (e.g., stem-C, sitz-C, lik-C).
   - This multi-task learning architecture ensures that both translation and morphological annotations are learned in tandem, leveraging the morphological knowledge encoded in the table.

4. **Forward and Backward Interaction**: The morphology table interacts with the decoder in both directions:
   - **Forward pass**: The table sends high-quality signals (auxiliary information) to the prediction layer, enriching the decoder's output and improving translation accuracy.
   - **Backward pass**: The external channel updates the morphology table by providing high-quality affix predictions during training, refining the table's contents.

5. **Integration Workflow**: When generating a word:
   - The first channel predicts the sequence of characters step-by-step.
   - The second channel simultaneously predicts the morphological labels for each character, ensuring that the predictions align with the morphological structure of the language.

This integration of auxiliary signals from the morphology table enables the decoder to produce translations that are both linguistically accurate and morphologically informed, particularly for morphologically rich languages (MRLs).",an additional morphology table including target-side affixes.

1. **Morphological Annotations**:
   - The second output channel is designed to predict morphological annotations for each character. These annotations include labels that indicate the **stem class** (e.g., `stem-C`), **suffix class** (e.g., `siz-C`), or other morphological properties of the target character. These labels provide additional linguistic information about the part of the word or morpheme the character belongs to.

2. **Translation Features**:
   - The primary output channel handles the generation of translations by predicting one character at a time for the target sequence.

3. **Morphology Table Features**:
   - A morphology table is used as an external knowledge repository, containing affixes of the target language. An attention module searches this table to find relevant affixes, which serve as auxiliary signals accompanying the main input sequence during translation.

4. **Multi-task Learning Features**:
   - The architecture incorporates multi-task learning, where one task focuses on generating translations and another task focuses on predicting morphological annotations. These tasks are combined into a single network to leverage shared representations and improve predictions.

5. **Attention Weights**:
   - The model uses attention weights (`βiu`) to determine the relevance of specific affixes in the morphology table when generating the target sequence. This mechanism helps amplify useful affixes and exclude irrelevant ones.

Specifically, any task that involves sequential or temporal data with attention mechanisms could benefit from this approach. For instance:

1. **Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** The visualization technique could be used to highlight parts of the source sentence or context that were most influential in generating specific parts of the target translation, helping researchers or users understand the translation process.

2. **Question Answering Systems:** Attention weight-based visuals could be applied to highlight the most relevant parts of a passage in relation to a given question, aiding in explainability and debugging.

3. **Sentiment Analysis over Time:** For tasks involving sentiment analysis across sequential text (e.g., reviews or social media posts), the method could highlight the sections that contributed most to sentiment shifts.

4. **Speech Recognition:** Attention weights could be visualized to show which parts of an audio signal were most significant in recognizing specific words or phrases.

5. **Time-Series Analysis:** In applications such as financial forecasting or medical diagnosis, attention-based visuals could help identify critical points in the data sequence that influenced predictions.

6. **Educational Tools:** For language learning or comprehension tasks, attention-based visuals could help learners focus on key parts of a text or conversation that carry the most meaning.

7. **Behavioral Analysis:** In human-computer interaction, this method could be applied to highlight critical moments in user behavior that led to specific system responses.

Combining multiple email ﬁlters based on mul- tivariate statistical analysis. In Intelligent Systems']","The data cleaning and filtering process consists of the following steps:

1. **Annotation of the Full Corpus**: Each person annotates the full corpus, including cycles of shaping the annotation guide and re-annotation. Initially, inter-annotator agreement (ITA) is relatively low (around 60-70%), especially for certain classes.

2. **Automatic Merging of Annotations**: Annotations are automatically merged based on the criterion that if three out of four annotators agree on an entity (class and start-stop boundaries), the annotation is retained. Otherwise, the entity is marked as ""CONFLICTED.""

3. **Team-Based Annotation**: Two teams of two annotators each go through the full corpus again, starting from the previous step. At this stage, the class-average ITA rises to over 85%.

4. **Automatic Entity Merging**: Automatic merging is performed to harmonize entity boundaries when both annotations agree.

5. **Final Review and Corrections**: One of the authors reviews the full corpus once more, correcting any remaining disagreements.

### Notes on Specific Challenges:
- **Inter-Annotator Agreement**: Certain entity classes, such as ORGANIZATION, LANGUAGE, and DATE, have high ITA scores (above 98%), while others like PRODUCT and FACILITY have lower ITA scores (less than 40% in the first annotation cycle).
- **Ambiguities in Classes**: Some classes (e.g., WORK_OF_ART, ORDINAL, and PERIOD) cause confusion due to overlapping definitions or unclear scopes. The annotation guide is refined to address these issues.
- **Exclusion of Low-Importance Classes**: Classes like PRODUCT and FACILITY, which are less clearly defined and documented, are reduced in scope or removed to streamline the annotation process.
- **Semantic Scope of Entities**: Efforts are made to annotate broad references to entities, such as pronouns or job positions, rather than strictly proper nouns.

Overall, the process incorporates both human and automated steps to ensure high-quality annotations, with iterative refinement to resolve ambiguities and improve consistency.","many news articles begin with reporter names, media agencies, dates or other contents irrelevant to the content to ensure that the summary is concise and the article contains enough salient information, we only keep articles with 10-150 words in the top three sentences and 150-1200 words in the rest, and that contain at least 6 sentences in total we try to remove articles whose top three sentences may not form a relevant summary",0,0,0,0.952193591

1. **Image Features**: Using a ResNet-152 model, they resized images to 224x224 and extracted 2048-dimensional feature vectors from the penultimate layer. These features are then used in classification tasks.

2. **Text Features**: A pre-trained text recognition model was employed to extract text from images of storefronts and landmarks. These text features, combined with embeddings from a learned lookup table or FastText, are used to predict the class probabilities.

3. **Combined Approach**: They experimented with combining ResNet image features and FastText embeddings. In one approach, they applied PCA to reduce dimensionality before feeding the features into the model.

Through these methods, they were able to construct distinct classes based on image and text data, enabling classification and verification tasks for landmarks.",inspired by the OntoNotes5 corpus BIBREF7 as well as the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) English Annotation Guidelines for Entities Version 6.6 2008.06.13 BIBREF8,0,0,0,0.7786257
